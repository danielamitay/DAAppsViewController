# DAAppsViewController

`DAAppsViewController` is a simple way of displaying apps from the App Store in an aesthetically similar manner. The user is able to view each app's App Store page by launching an instance of `SKStoreProductViewController`. Particularly useful for showing an app developer's other apps.

## Installation

- Copy over the `DAAppsViewController` folder to your project folder.
- Add the **StoreKit** framework to your project.
- `#import "DAAppsViewController.h"`

### App Transport Security Settings

As of iOS 9.0, App Transport Security (ATS) is enforcing additional security requirements for HTTP-based networking requests. As a result, the images that `DAAppsViewController` attempts to load from Apple are unable to load without the proper exceptions. To make sure that everything works as expected, make sure to add the following settings to your app's Info.plist file. If your app has `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads: true` enabled, then this is unnecessary.

## Usage

Example project included (DAAppsViewControllerExample)

### Displaying apps by a specific developer (useful for "Our other apps")

```objective-c
DAAppsViewController *appsViewController = [[DAAppsViewController alloc] init];
[appsViewController loadAppsWithArtistId:356087517 completionBlock:nil];
[self.navigationController pushViewController:appsViewController animated:YES];
```

### Displaying a predetermined set of apps

By **appId**:
```objective-c
NSArray *appsArray = @[@575647534,@498151501,@482453112,@582790430,@543421080];
DAAppsViewController *appsViewController = [[DAAppsViewController alloc] init];
appsViewController.pageTitle = @"Apps by XXX"; // Optional
[appsViewController loadAppsWithAppIds:appsArray completionBlock:nil];
[self.navigationController pushViewController:appsViewController animated:YES];
```

By **bundleId**:
```objective-c
NSArray *bundlesArray = @[@"com.flexibits.fantastical.iphone",@"com.samvermette.Transit",@"com.tripsyapp.tripsy",@"com.seatgeek.SeatGeek",@"com.bumptechnologies.flock.Release"];
DAAppsViewController *appsViewController = [[DAAppsViewController alloc] init];
[appsViewController loadAppsWithBundleIds:bundlesArray completionBlock:nil];
[self.navigationController pushViewController:appsViewController animated:YES];
```

### Displaying apps for a specific App Store search term

```objective-c
DAAppsViewController *appsViewController = [[DAAppsViewController alloc] init];
[appsViewController loadAppsWithSearchTerm:@"Radio" completionBlock:nil];
[self.navigationController pushViewController:appsViewController animated:YES];
```
